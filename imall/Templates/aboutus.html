    <h1><b>Team</b></h1>
    <p>iShop is maintained by a small team of developers. We’re actively looking to grow this team and would love to
        hear from you if you’re excited about our website.</p>
    <h1><b>History</b></h1>

    <p>
        Ishop was founded in October 2007 by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, who were both alumni of the Indian
        Institute of Technology Delhi and formerly worked for Amazon. The company initially focused on
        online book sales with country-wide shipping. Following its launch, Ishop slowly grew in prominence; by 2008, it
        was receiving 100 orders per day. In 2010, Ishop acquired the Bangalore-based social book discovery service
        WeRead from Lulu.com.
    </p>
    <p>
        In late 2011, Ishop made several acquisitions relating to digital distribution, including Mime360.com and
        the digital content library of Bollywood portal Chakpak.
    </p>
    <p>
        In February 2012, the company unveiled its DRM-free online music store Flyte. However, the service was
        unsuccessful due to competition from free streaming sites, and shut down in June 2013.
    </p>
    <p>
        In May 2012, Ishop acquired Letsbuy, an online electronics retailer. In May 2014, Ishop acquired Myntra, an
        online fashion retailer, for ₹20 billion (US$280 million). Myntra continues to operate alongside Ishop as a
        standalone subsidiary; the site focuses on an upscale, "fashion-conscious" market, while Ishop itself focuses on
        the mainstream market and major international brands.
    </p>
    <p>
        In February 2014, Ishop partnered with Motorola Mobility to be the exclusive Indian retailer of its Moto G
        smartphone. Motorola also partnered with Ishop on the Moto E—a phone targeted primarily towards emerging
        markets such as India. High demand for the phone caused the Ishop website to crash following its midnight launch
        on 14 May. Ishop subsequently held exclusive Indian launches for other smartphones, including the Xiaomi Mi3
        in July 2014 (whose initial release of 10,000 devices sold out in around 5 seconds), the Redmi 1S and Redmi
        Note in late-2014 (which saw similarly accelerated sellouts), and Micromax's Yu Yunique 2 in
        2017.[36]
    </p>
    <p>
        On 6 October 2014, in honour of the company's anniversary and the Diwali season, Ishop held a major sale
        across the service that it promoted as "Big Billion Day". The event generated a surge of traffic, selling US$100
        million worth of goods in 10 hours. The event received criticism via social media over technical issues the site
        experienced during the event, as well as stock shortages.
    </p>
    <p>
        In March 2015, Ishop blocked access to its website on mobile devices and began requiring that users download the
        site's mobile app instead. The following month, Myntra went further and discontinued its website on all
        platforms, in favour of operating exclusively through its app. The "app-only" model, however, proved to be
        unsuccessful for Myntra (reducing sales by 10%), and its main website was reinstated in February 2016. The
        experiment with Myntra led to suggestions that Ishop itself would perform a similar move, but this did not
        occur. In November 2015, Ishop launched a new mobile website branded as "Ishop Lite", which provides an
        experience inspired by Ishop's app that runs within smartphone web browsers.
    </p>
    <p>
        In April 2015, Ishop acquired Appiterate, a Delhi-based mobile marketing automation firm. Ishop stated that it
        would use its technology to enhance its mobile services. In October 2015, Ishop reprised its Big Billion Day
        event, except as a multi-day event that would be exclusive to the Ishop app. Ishop also stated that it had
        bolstered its supply chain and introduced more fulfillment centres in order to meet customer demand. Ishop
        achieved a gross merchandise volume of US$300 million during the event, with the largest volumes coming from
        fashion sales, and the largest value coming from mobiles.
    </p>
    <p>
        In December 2015, Ishop purchased a minority stake in the digital mapping provider MapmyIndia. The company
        stated that it would licence its data to help improve delivery logistics. In 2016, Ishop acquired the online
        fashion retailer Jabong.com from Rocket Internet for US$70 million, as well as the UPI mobile payments startup
        PhonePe. In January 2017, Ishop made a US$2 million investment in Tinystep, a parenting information
        startup.
    </p>
    <p>
        In April 2017, eBay announced that it would sell its Indian subsidiary eBay.in to Ishop and make a US$500
        million cash investment in the company. eBay promoted that the partnership would eventually allow Ishop to
        access eBay's network of international vendors, and vice versa, but these plans never actually came to
        fruition. In July 2017, Ishop made an offer to acquire its main domestic competitor, Snapdeal, for
        around US$700–800 million. It was rejected by the company, which was seeking at least US$1 billion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ishop held a 51% share of all Indian smartphone shipments in 2017, overtaking Amazon India (33%). Ishop sold
        1.3 million phones in 20 hours on 21 September alone for its Big Billion Days promotion, doubling the number
        sold on the first day of the event in 2016 (where it sold a total of 2.5 million phones in five days).
    </p>
    <p>
        In August 2019, Ishop entered into a partnership with Authentic Brands to license and distribute Nautica in
        India.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ishop has invested $4 million (about Rs 29 crore) in customer engagement and rewards platform EasyRewardz on
        Tuesday Nov 19 2019. 2020
    </p>
    <p>
        Ishop invested US$35 million or Rs 260 Crore in Arvind Fashions Limited's subsidiary Arvind Youth Brands and
        picked up around 27% stake. The newly formed subsidiary, Arvind Youth Brands will own Flying Machine.
